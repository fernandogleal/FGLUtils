#' Prepare a path for use in a script
#'
#' The function is used to prepare a path for use in a script. The path can either be supplied as an argument or entered by the user.
#' It will convert any backslashes (\) in the path to forward slashes (/), as forward slashes are more commonly used in R.
#' It also assigns the prepared path to a global variable 'caminho' for further use in the script and writes the path to the clipboard.
#'
#' @param path The path to prepare. If not supplied, the user will be prompted to enter the path. Defaults to "clipboard".
#' @return The prepared path.

    readline()
  }

  # removes quotes from the path

  # convert backslashes to forward slashes
  x <- chartr("\\", "/", x)

  # assigns prepared path to global variable 'caminho'
